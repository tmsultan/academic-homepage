# Pakistani Sign Language flashcards
I created Anki flashcards to help people learn Pakistani Sign Language (PSL). They can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gjW_BXbR5QyU8G49l8h3s9d4aWUkxLQT/view).


### Anki Video
I created a video in Urdu to guide users through downloading and installing Anki, explaining the spaced repetition principle it is based on, and importing PSL deck cards into Anki. You can access it [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jiDgT3GR3RsADfU_7y_10nqY6KUNwZjm/view).


### FlashCard Structure
The flashcards connect three different languages:
1. English <--> PSL
2. Urdu <--> PSL
3. English <--> Urdu

There are a total of 5 different fields within each card:
1. English: The closest English translation of the sign
2. Sign: The PSL Sign
3. Urdu: The closest Urdu translation of the sign
4. Lips: Lip movements can sometimes add meaning when signing. In sign language linguistics, this is known as a [mouth morpheme](https://www.lifeprint.com/asl101/topics/mouth-morphemes-in-asl.htm). Since Deaf individuals communicate in a predominantly hearing world, these movements are often influenced by the surrounding spoken language, which in this case is Urdu.
5. Remarks: Personal notes that help me connect different signs and remember them better. Feel free to ignore them if they donâ€™t make sense to you.
