  <p>
  I am completing my PhD in Electrical and Computer Engineering at UWâ€“Madison in the  <a href = "https://biostat.wisc.edu/~compoptics/"> Computational Optics Lab </a>, where I am fortunate to be advised by <a href = "https://biostat.wisc.edu/~velten/"> Andreas Velten </a>. Our research focuses on developing next-generation imaging systems by integrating novel sensor technologies (SPAD, CMOS, PMT) with advanced signal processing and deep learning reconstruction algorithms for a wide range of applications including 3D imaging, non-line-of-sight imaging, and microscopy.
  </p>
  <p>
  With a strong background in optics, sensor technologies, and imaging pipelines, I specialize in building optical hardware setups, integrating SPAD, CMOS, and PMT sensors, and developing computational methods for imaging and sensing. I am passionate about advancing high-performance sensing solutions and am seeking opportunities in optics and sensor development to drive innovations in imaging, vision systems, or next-generation display technologies.
