  We present a graphical representation of the two-frequency spatial Wigner distribution (TFSWD) forward model, which integrates multiple NLOS imaging modalities. Through experimental validation, we demonstrate that the model more accurately captures light transport and wave propagation, paving the way for future improvements in reconstruction
