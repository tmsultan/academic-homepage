  We show that planar diffuse surfaces can act as virtual mirrors in non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging when using structured light modulation at centimeter-scale wavelengths. Leveraging this effect, we extend NLOS imaging beyond the third bounce, enabling the reconstruction of mirror reflections of objects hidden around two corners.
