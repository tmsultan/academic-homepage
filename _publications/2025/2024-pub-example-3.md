  We demonstrate that the measurement space for non-line-of-sight imaging can be compressed, enabling the development of novel computational methods for 3D diffraction propagation. These methods allow for flexible measurement schemes and significantly enhance reconstruction speed while maintaining reconstruction quality comparable to state-of-the-art methods.
