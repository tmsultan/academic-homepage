  abstract = {Non-line-of-sight imaging methods reconstruct images from light captured off a relay surface. In most prior work this relay surface is a diffuse plane. It has been shown that even small deviations from a planar relay wall geometry quickly degrade reconstruction quality. Although existing methods can account for relay surface geometry in a straightforward way, they typically have high computational complexity and take orders of magnitude longer time to compute than state-of-the-art planar methods. In this work, we propose a fast algorithm that can perform non-line-of-sight reconstruction on arbitrary non-planar relay surfaces. Our algorithm has the same computational and memory complexity as the fastest existing algorithms, yet it achieves comparable reconstruction quality to the widely-used slower algorithms.},
